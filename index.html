  <h1> San Jose Sharks </h1>
    <p>The San Jose Sharks are an NHL team based in San Jose, California and are the Western Conference Champions of the 2015-16 season. For the first time in the team's 25-year history, they made it to the Stanley Cup Final but fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>

  <p>I looked at the San Jose Sharks' official <a href="http://sharks.nhl.com/">website</a> and compared it to mine. I like the website because it's aesthetically pleasing and has good design. One of the things I noticed in the source code is that they assigned div id's, which I assume were used to style the page using CSS. Other than that, there were some elements I recognized like tables and unordered lists.</p>
